/**
 * A 'binary' implementation of {@link Search} works by taking an <b>ordered</b> data set and identifying which
 * half of the data set contains the value. It will continue to break the data set down until the value is found.
 *
 * <p>The binary search is a good tool for searching through medium and larger data sets. This is because it is an
 * O(log n) efficiency search. It achieves this by eliminating half the results that don't match each time.</p>
